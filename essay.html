<!-- I have used https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-cyber-security and https://www.treefrog.ca/what-is-web-design to gather and compare these 2 jobs -->
<p>The age of computers is here,community have been interracting with computers a lot nowadays.They are playing a big role in our lives.Industry has been changed dramatically with the revolution of computers.Whole proffesions interact with computers in order to keep up with the technology and use their times efficiently.The change of industry let to evolving brand new jobs for example there was no mobile applications 10 years ago.With this action whole new industry opened up for mobile games and mobile applications with the release of iphone in 2007.On the other hand web development and web desing has been around for more years.</p>

<p>  Also like every industry security is key. To be able to protect whats yours.It  is always a priority which evolved cyber security which protects you from the attacks around the world directed to you and your website or your personal details.</p>
 
 <p> Cyber security is the most exiciting job option in my opinion, you get to fight with cyber criminals in order to find justice.It might be a bit boring thats what i came across with when i made a research about it on google, flexible working hours and keeping your servers secure, it might seem like an boring job after couple of years but the excitement of fighting with crime must be fun.On the other hand web development seems a bit null when compared with cyber security, coding and creating new things is fun but the idea of designing and making a nice interface for a web site seems boring in my opinion.With my experience with web i kind of liked it, it seemed boring at first but when you get the hang of it, it is entertaining and also it feels great to complete a code and see what you came up with.Architects must feel the same way as web developers, creating an incredible thing from nothing.</p>
 
 <p> Furthermore, when it comes to comparing incomes a cyber security worker can make 27k$ up to 67k$ a year however a web developer can make 33k$ up to 70k$.For both of the jobs you need to be up to date with whats out there, read a lot of books to be prepared for any incoming job requests.</p>
