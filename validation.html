<p>  It was my first time experiencing with coding and html, i had a shaky start to this year but after putting 3-4 hours a week outside class it all seemed simple.First classes were really frightening everyone around me had an idea what they were doing, i was just sitting there trying to follow the slides and activities.But as i mentioned before, after putting the hours outside class it was whole lot easier.I just wish there was some kind of book or something solid to hold on to because i remember almost having a mental breakdown after first 2 classes i had no idea what was going on.If we had a book or e-book  that starts from the basic coding it would have helped a lot and gave me the confidence that i needed.

<p>  I did get on well with html and css pretty easily,however i do struggle with using photoshop and working on the general design of the web page.For instance i needed a lot of extra research about colours to use at my webpage and also i did get a lot of cool ideas from my team mates.Instead of using photoshop i used adobe fireworks cs5 which is a program that i am more familiar with.I have created a logo and an animation.
